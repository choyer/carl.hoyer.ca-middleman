Weekly round-up of the top sites that affected me deeply. Some of these might even change your life.

## [dtrx: Do The Right Extraction](http://brettcsmith.org/2007/dtrx/)

The command line "intelligent archive extraction" tool that just knows how to extract all types of archive types (`tar, zip, cpio, deb, rpm, gem, 7z, cab, lzh, rar, gz, bz2, lzma, xz`) without having to know all the command line arguments. It even handles archives with extra compression (`tar.bz2`), puts extracted files into its own directory, fixes file permissions and can recursively extract archives within archives.

Simply run `$ dtrx random-tarball.tar.gz` and you've got your archive in the directory `random-tarball`. That's pure awesomeness.

Created by Brett Smith. Licensed under the [GNU GPL v3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/). Works fine for me on OS X 10.8.


## [Emmet](http://emmet.io/)

Previously named *Zen Coding*, it's the "web-developer's toolkit to greatly improve your HTML & CSS workflow". Plugins are [available for download](http://emmet.io/download/) for a plethora of text editors. How cool is Emmet? Here's a sample of its handy work:

```
ul>li.item$*5
```

Automagically turns into this:

```
<ul>
    <li class="item1"></li>
    <li class="item2"></li>
    <li class="item3"></li>
    <li class="item4"></li>
    <li class="item5"></li>
</ul>
```

## [BBC describes Intel's NUC as about the size of 80 teabags](http://markkit.net/untrusted/www.bbc.co.uk_news_technology-21588419.html)

I just can't seem to [visualize the size of 80 teabags](https://www.google.ca/search?q=what+does+80+teabags+look+like&hl=en&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=yQlVUcvcK9bF4AO2mICgDQ&ved=0CDIQsAQ&biw=1323&bih=1036). This must be a British thing. I'm seeking clarification:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/bbcnews">bbcnews</a> Is being able to visualize the size of something "about the size of a box of 80 teabags" a British thing? <a href="http://t.co/TCwC9H39Ov" title="http://markkit.net/untrusted/www.bbc.co.uk_news_technology-21588419.html">markkit.net/untrusted/www.â€¦</a></p>&mdash; Carl Hoyer (@choyer) <a href="https://twitter.com/choyer/status/317289080721403906">March 28, 2013</a></blockquote>

Still waiting for a reply!


## [David H. Hansson and Jason Calacanis talk about Groupon, Yahoo, remote work ...](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3488-i-talk-to-jason-calacanis-about-groupon)

Always a breath of fresh air to listen to DHH talk. Not as 'electric' as the their [first discussion](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDGHxO6N3Ms), but always worth the time.


## [Daft Punk: Random Access Memories](http://randomaccessmemories.com/)

The anticipation and the countless remix's/edits/mashups generated from the French duo's 15-second teaser for their upcomming album release is so incredible it warrants inclusion.

My personal favourite (how to turn a 15-second teaser into a 3:26 edit):
