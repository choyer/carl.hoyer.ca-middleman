## [Google Chrome Switching to Blink Rendering Engine](http://blog.chromium.org/2013/04/blink-rendering-engine-for-chromium.html)

The big news within the web developer community is the Google switch from [WebKit](http://www.webkit.org/) to their own rendering engine named [Blink](http://www.chromium.org/blink), which at this point is simply a fork of WebKit, in Chrome.

Google's main reasons for doing this are Chromes use of a multi-process architecture that differs from the other WebKit-based browsers and providing a clean slate to explore performance improvements specific to Chrome and the V8 JavaScript engine.

The big fear amongst web developers is whether this will fragment cross-browser compatibility and standards. Google has addressed some of these fears through a [developer FAQ](http://www.chromium.org/blink/developer-faq) page that includes a video Q&A. Only time will tell what impact this truly has.

On April 1, Google [revealed](http://youtu.be/_qFFHC0eIUc) Captain William Kidd's [treasure map](https://maps.google.com/maps?t=8) with clues and secrets to a long lost treasure that you can help uncover.

## [Kris Holm Unicycles External Disc Brake (EDB) Standard](http://krisholm.com/en/edb)

[Kris Holm Unicycles](http://krisholm.com) has released a page, with the assistance of yours truly, describing why Kris chose to affix the disc rotor to the crank rather than the hub.
