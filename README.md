My personal site, an experiment in static site generation powered by [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/).

### Building

This site is built and deployed to S3 via [middleman-s3_sync](https://github.com/fredjean/middleman-s3_sync) using the command `AWS_ACCESS_KEY='<not going to tell you>' AWS_SECRET='<definitely not going to tell you>' bundle exec middleman build --clean`
